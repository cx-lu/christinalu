I've been wanting a portfolio site for a while, but in the end, I thought it'd be fun to make something a lil more ~intimate~. So here's a digital window into my life atm. Things I'm making, words I'm jotting down, files I have on my real desktop. Have fun looking around â€” I hope you like what you find!<br \/><br \/>&lt;3, christina"

She said the house we were in used to belong to a lady with a facial scar, but the &quot;new rule&quot; (forgot what this i)? Caused the lady to be treated badly by others. I don't remember the details that well but I do remember speaking Chinese to her really well<br \/><br \/>Jul 9, 2020 &gt; I had a dream about Pokemon where some bad guy napalmed our city and I used my squirrel turtle to fly away and it used an eye power on the whole city except the eye power didn't work and it started bleeding so I reassured it that I was at fault so that it wouldn't cry<br \/><br \/>Jul 24, 2018 &gt; I was taking some Japanese test that I never prepared for on Japan history and culture, and the teacher said she felt guilty because research made her feel like she wasn't teaching facts, and I was just gonna Wong it, and Carlyn and I had this stage performance where we had to make a really complicated transition and hadn't practiced it was a mess"
